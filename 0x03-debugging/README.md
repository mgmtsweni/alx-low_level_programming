1Task 0. Multiple mains
	Test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0
Task 1. Like, comment, subscribe
	 Comment out (donâ€™t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.
Task 2. 0 > 972?
	This program prints the largest of three integers.
	Fix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
Task 3. Leap year
	This program converts a date to the day of year and determines how many days are left in the year, taking leap year into consideration
	Fix the print_remaining_days() function so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years.
